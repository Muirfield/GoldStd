Implements an economy plugin based on Gold Ingots (by default) as the
currency.

Basic Usage:

* pay $$
* balance
* shopkeep spawn [player|location] [shop]

To pay people you tap on them while holding a gold ingot.

## Documentation

GoldStd implements an economy plugin based on Gold Ingots (by default)
as the currency.  This allows to add game mechanics to the game
without artificial commands or other artificial constructs.

You can then pay people without using the chat console.  Also, you may
lose all your money if you get killed.  Players can stash their gold
on Chests, but they would need to guard them (just like in real life),
etc.  You can see how much money you have directly in the inventory
window, etc.

### Commands

The chat console commands are there for convenience but are not needed
for regular gameplay:

* pay $$  
  By default when you tap on another player, only 1 gold ingot get
  transferred.  This command can be used to facilitate larger
  transactions.  If you use this command the next tap will transfer
  the desired amount in one go.
* balance  
  If you are rich enough, your money will be in multiple stacks.  This
  commands will add the stacks for you.
* shopkeep  
  This command is used to manage shop keepers.  Sub-commands:
  - /shopkeep spawn [player|location] [shop]
    - player - Shop keepr will be spawn where this player is located.
    - location: x,y,z or x,y,z,yaw,pitch or x,y,z,yaw,pitch,world
    - shop - shop definition from configuration file.

### Signs

GoldStd supports three types of signs.

1. Shop signs
2. Gambling signs
3. Trading signs

#### Shop Signs

Place a sign with the following text:

    [CODE]
    [SHOP]
    Item_name [x10]
    price
    <anything>
    [/CODE]

Players will be able to buy the specified items at the set price.
Defaults to 1, but this can be changed with the x?? modifier.

    [CODE]
    [CASINO]

The odds is the number of chances, so the higher the number the less
chance of payout.  Payout is how much you get pay if you win.  Price

## FAQ

* Q: What do I do if the item name does not fit in the sign?
* A: For those case you should use the Item ID and if you need more descrption add it to line 4, or on a different sign.
* Q: Where do I find a list of the proper item names?
* A: This uses PocketMine definitions (like the /give command).  You can find the list here:
  * [PocketMine Source](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/item/Item.php#L39)
  * Note that item names are case insensitive.  You can use the names or the ids.
* Q: Where do I find a list of the proper effect names?
  * [PocketMine Source](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/entity/Effect.php#L32)
  * You can use these names or the ids.
* Q: How do I set a staring amount of money for players?
* A: Use SpawnMgr or ItemSpawn to define an initial inventory which should include gold ingots.
* Q: How can I use a different money plugin?
* A: Set the currency to false in config.yml.  Then GoldStd will search for an
  alternate money plugin.
